        <h3>At Jamals Epic Zoo</h3>
        <p>
            And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins. But there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process
            it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. In fact, a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. Because you have absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing
            that can be questioned.

            Take for instance its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies. Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's
            a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do
            his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it.
